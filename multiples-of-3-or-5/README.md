# Multiples of 3 or 5

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

The answer is: **233168**

The solution brute forces through all the natural number betweens 0 - 1000 and checks if they are a multiple of 3 or 5 using the modulus operator
